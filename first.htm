		<h2>Hello world -- Intro To Earth</h2>
		<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only 
		astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of Earth's 
		surface is land consisting of continents and islands. 
		The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but 
		also by lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute 
		the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. 
		Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates 
		that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's 
		interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer
		core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle
		that drives plate tectonics.</p>
